"""Per-organization WebSocket connection manager (Section 16 Real-Time Sync).

An owner edits a plan on the web and it appears on their phone in under ~2s: the
mutation calls ``manager.broadcast(org_id, event)`` and every socket scoped to
that org receives the JSON event. Connections are grouped by ``organization_id``
so an event for one tenant never reaches another (tenant isolation extends to the
realtime layer, Security Rule #1).

The manager holds no DB state and is a process-local singleton. In a multi-worker
deployment a Redis pub/sub fan-out would sit behind ``broadcast``; the call sites
do not change. ``broadcast`` is best-effort: a send failure just drops that dead
socket, it never breaks the request doing the mutation.
