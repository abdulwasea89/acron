"""Swarm orchestration: plan, fan out, distil, summarise (ADR 019).

The whole multi-agent turn lives here, in one function the graph node calls. Four
phases:

1. **Plan** — one model call. The roster is the menu; the model decides how many
   agents the question needs and which ones, and writes each a sub-question. The
   size is the planner's, not a constant: one specialist is the right answer to
   "how many members do I have", forty to "how is the business doing". This also
   doubles as the gate — a question no specialist can help with plans ``direct``
   and the turn falls back to the ordinary ReAct path without spending anything
   further.
2. **Fan out** — every chosen specialist runs concurrently. Forty agents take as
   long as the slowest one, not the sum, which is the entire point.
3. **Distil** — one model call per domain that actually ran, concurrently. The
   orchestrator reads only its own specialists' findings and writes a digest.
   This is what makes it an orchestrator rather than a ``gather``: forty raw
   findings do not fit in a prompt, five digests do.
4. **Summarise** — one model call over the five digests, streamed to the client
   as ``delta`` frames so the answer types out exactly as it does on the direct
   path.

A swarm turn is therefore ~7 model calls plus whichever judgement specialists
were dispatched — not forty, which is what makes running forty defensible.
