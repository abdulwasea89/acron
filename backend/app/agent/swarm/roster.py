"""The roster: 5 domains, 40 specialists (ADR 019).

Each entry is a named analyst with a fixed remit. Thirty-two are deterministic —
a single read-only aggregate over the org's tables, exact and effectively free.
The eight marked ``model_backed`` are the ones where the answer is a judgement
(a risk read, a conflict, a quality gap) rather than a number; those gather their
own evidence first and then ask, so the model reasons over real rows rather than
over the question alone.

Two things every specialist obeys:

* It takes no ``org_id``. Tenant scope comes from the ``AgentContext`` the
  orchestrator binds, exactly as the tools do (ADR 018 §3, Security Rule #1).
  Forty specialist prompts is forty chances to be careless, so the roster is
  never given the chance: none of these functions accepts a scope argument.
* It returns a :class:`Finding`. An agent with nothing to look at returns
  ``skipped`` with a reason rather than an empty string, so the UI can show the
  row as accounted-for instead of silently dropping it.
