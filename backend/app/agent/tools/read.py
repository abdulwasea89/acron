"""Read tools: live org data for the assistant (ADR 018).

Every tool wraps the same service the dashboard reads, so the assistant and the
UI report identical numbers. None takes an ``org_id``: it comes from
``current_context()`` (Security Rule #1). Docstrings are the model's API docs —
they are written for the model, not the developer.

Tools return JSON strings (see ``_serialize.as_tool_result``), which is what the
tool protocol expects and what avoids an empty ``list`` return becoming invalid
``role:tool`` content.
