"""Request-scoped context for an assistant run.

Tenant identity — ``org_id``, ``user_id``, ``role`` — and the request's DB
session live here, never in a tool signature. Tools read them through
``current_context()``; the model cannot pass an ``org_id`` argument, so a
confused or prompt-injected model cannot widen its scope (Security Rule #1).

Why a ``ContextVar`` rather than LangGraph runtime context: this works with a
graph compiled once, for every tool, without threading a runtime argument
through each tool. It is the same request-scoped pattern FastAPI uses for
dependencies, and it is set immediately around the graph run by ``service``.
