"""Attendance: one member gym visit — the behaviour signal (Section 1.3, #18).

Every front-desk check-in, QR scan, self-check-in or class attendance becomes an
append-only row here. This is the "what members do" stream the retention model
needs: the blueprint calls non-attendance the strongest churn predictor, and
without it churn scoring has nothing to reason over.

Rows are tenant-scoped (``organization_id``) so the isolation filter is a plain
column predicate (Security Rule #1). They are point events — a member may check
in more than once a day — and carry ``idempotency_key`` so a double-tap cannot
create two visits.
