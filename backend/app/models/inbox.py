"""Shared team inbox: member conversations across channels (Section 1.3, #20).

One thread per contact per channel, holding every inbound and outbound message,
who owns it, and its state. This is the shared inbox the front desk works from —
distinct from the AI assistant's own ``Conversation``/``ConversationMessage``
threads, which are per-staff chat with the model, not with members.

Tenant-scoped on both tables (Security Rule #1): the org filter is a plain column
predicate, no join needed. Unknown senders (a lead messaging before they are a
member) are supported: ``member_id`` is null and the thread is keyed on the
channel handle. When a handle matches a known member, we link it.
