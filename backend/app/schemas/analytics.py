"""Analytics schemas (Section 16 web analytics + mobile headline metrics).

Headline metrics are industry-shaped: the org's vertical decides which KPI keys
the service returns (gym keeps today_check_ins / today_revenue / …; office
returns occupied_seats / occupancy_pct / space_mrr / outstanding_invoices). The
fields here are the union, each optional, and the endpoint strips unset keys so
a gym payload stays byte-identical and an office payload carries only office
keys.
