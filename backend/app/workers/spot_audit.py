"""Weekly spot-audit job for auto-approved receipts (Section 10.5).

Picks ~5% of auto-approved receipts that were flagged for audit and surfaces
them to the admin queue. Deterministic selection happened at scoring time
(``spot_audit_selected``); this job simply collects them for review and tracks
the weekly reversal rate used to tune the auto-approve threshold (Section 10.6).

Runnable inline (no Celery broker needed) for local dev/tests.
