"""Stripe webhook signature verification with a stub fallback (Section 17).

Each webhook endpoint verifies the Stripe signature before trusting the payload
(CLAUDE.md "Webhook Endpoints"). When a signing secret is configured and the
``stripe`` SDK is present, ``construct_event`` enforces the HMAC signature and
timestamp. When no secret is configured (local/dev/stub mode), the raw JSON body
is parsed directly so the webhook flow is runnable end-to-end without Stripe.

Raises ``WebhookError`` on a bad signature / malformed payload; the route maps it
to a 400 so Stripe will retry.
