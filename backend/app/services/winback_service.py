"""Win-back: re-engaging lapsed members (#36).

A member who expired or cancelled is not necessarily gone — a well-timed,
respectful offer recovers a meaningful share of them. This service lists who has
lapsed, runs a campaign that sends the offer (with a cooldown so nobody is
pestered), and records recovery when the member reactivates — turning win-back
into a measurable "money recovered" number (the seed of the Wins feed, #67).
