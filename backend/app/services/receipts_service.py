"""Receipt upload & admin review service (Section 10.5, 10.7).

Members upload a receipt image (the pipeline runs inline and routes it). Admins
work the review queue: approve / reject / request more info, and can reverse an
auto-approval found bad on audit (member status reverts, member notified).
Every action is audited (Security Rule #10).
