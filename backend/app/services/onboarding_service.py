"""90-day onboarding journey service (#32).

A new member's first 90 days are the highest-leverage window for retention. This
service owns the journey clock: it starts a journey when a member becomes ACTIVE,
advances it one calendar day at a time, fires the day-based milestones (member
nudges + staff actions), tracks attendance adherence, and closes the journey at
day 90.

The milestone catalog is code (``CATALOG``) rather than a table: it is versioned
with the app and needs no per-tenant seed rows. Per-member state lives in
``OnboardingMilestoneProgress``.

Design notes:

* Milestones fire once, tracked by ``(journey_id, code)``.
* A milestone more than ``_FRESH_DAYS`` past its due date is completed silently
  (no email/notification). This makes the daily worker safe to run against
  existing members — backfilled journeys do not spam anyone.
* Non-attendance is the strongest churn predictor (blueprint): a member past
  day 7 with zero visits in the last 7 days raises exactly one staff task.
