"""Stripe webhook event handlers (Section 17 "Stripe Integration Details").

Two endpoints feed this service:

  * Platform (SaaS) — the platform's own account:
      - invoice.payment_succeeded     -> extend the org's SaaS period, mark ACTIVE
      - invoice.payment_failed        -> start the grace workflow (past_due)
      - customer.subscription.deleted -> mark the org cancelled

  * Connect (member payments) — the gym's connected account:
      - account.updated          -> sync stripe_connect_status
      - payment_intent.succeeded -> record the member payment + activate membership
      - payment_intent.payment_failed -> notify the member (retry allowed)
      - charge.refunded          -> reflect the refund on the payment record

Handlers are idempotent: each looks up existing state (by Stripe id) and is safe
to replay, because Stripe delivers webhooks at-least-once. Unknown event types
are acknowledged and ignored so Stripe stops retrying.
