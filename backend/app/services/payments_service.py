"""Payment history & refunds (Sections 13, Stripe Connect refunds).

Lists payment history for the org or a member. Refunds are idempotent
(Security Rule #2), web-only and admin-gated (Security Rule #7), and routed
through the gym's Stripe Connect account — never the platform account
(Security Rule #3). Card refunds call Connect; cash/offline refunds are recorded
directly.
